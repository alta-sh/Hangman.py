# A Discord Hangman Bot written in Python
hangman.py is an interactive bot for Discord that will play Hangman with your server members.
### Commands:
* **hang!help** - Will provide an embed of all commands for the bot.
* **hang!play** - Starts a Hangman game.
* **hang!guess** - If you're feeling adventurous you can guess the word (only usable whilst in a Hangman game).
* **hang!prefix** - Changes the command prefix for the bot to whatever you want.
* **end** - Writing this whilst in a Hangman game will end the game.

### Using the bot:
Simply clone the repository, and replace the line of text in `token.txt` with your bot token.
